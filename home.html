                <h3>My name is Leonid Zadorozhnykh.</h3>
                <p>I am 4th semester student at Haaga-Helia UAS studying Business IT (Web Application
                Development path). However, I progressed faster, took extra courses, and for 3 semesters got
                161 credits with average grade 4+. I am highly motivated to complete my studies within 2-2.5 years
                instead of 3.5. Now I have to complete just two more courses, do my work placement
                and write the thesis.</p>

                <p>During my studies at Haaga-Helia, I learned Web Application Development. I am familiar with
                modern web development and ready to learn real development process. I am a quick learner,
                problem solver and want to develop myself as a developer. I am a team player and feel myself
                comfortable in different teams. My native language is Russian; my English is enough for
                IT/Business communication and my Finish is at beginner level for basic communications.</p>

                <p>I am looking for a work placement as web developer where I can apply my skills and learn new
                technologies. I am interested in both front and back end development and willing to become
                full stack developer. </p>
